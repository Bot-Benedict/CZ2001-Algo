=============================== SUBMISSIONS ==================================
Small graph refers to our self-made graph while large graph refers to the >1million node graph
downloaded online.

The submission for Q1 part A and B are in './output/' directory titled
'small_graph_Q1_A_B.txt' and 'large_graph_Q1_A_B.txt'. 

The submission for Q1 part C and D are in './output/' directory titled
'small_graph_Q1_C_D.txt' and 'large_graph_Q1_C_D.txt'.

============================= RUN INSTRUCTIONS ===============================
The large graph (> 1million nodes) and a small graph are in the text file stored 
in the './input/' directory.

You can run the python script through any IDE of your choice, or through the command prompt.
Outputs of each script is written in the './output/' directory. 

The Part_A_B.py outputs to './output/small_graph_Q1_A_B.txt' and './output/large_graph_Q1_A_B.txt'

The Part_C_D.py outputs to './output/small_graph_Q1_C_D.txt' and './output/large_graph_Q1_C_D.txt'

======================= CUSTOM GRAPH INSTRUCTIONS ============================
To run a custom graph, place a text file titled 'custom_graph.txt' containing 
the graph information into the './input/' directory.

To run part A or B of question 1 with a custom graph, run the file 'Custom_Part_A_B.py'. 
Output of the file would be a .txt file in './output/custom_graph_Q1_A_B.txt' directory.

To run part C or D of question 1 with a custom graph, run the file 'Custom_Part_C_D.py'. 
K is currently set to 3 by default, should you wish to increase the K number please edit line 49.
Output of the file would be a .txt file in './output/custom_graph_Q1_C_D.txt' directory.
